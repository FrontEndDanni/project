  <p>I have had a craving for creativity as early as I could remember. 
    As soon as I was able to pick up a pencil, my family and I both knew that I was going to follow that pursuit for creativity. 
    It wouldn't stop at drawing; instead, my early-obsession with technology would merge with my eye for visual aesthetics and my knack for problem-solving. 
    I knew I had to expand my abilities to beautiful layouts and web pages.

  <p>When I'm not working on polishing web applications and web pages, I'm brewing my favorite roast, designing 
    characters, and visiting the local zoo. Alongside my passion for web design and visual arts is my love for biology- particularly marine. 
    Truly, a moment spent doing any of the above is not a moment wasted.

<p>My creativity is easily my strongest trait, and it is something I will always bring to the table. 
  Aside from the fact it lets me really expand on my designs, it allows me the ability to think outside the box, something I find to be extremely helpful in 
  the coding arena.
